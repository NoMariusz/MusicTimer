Simple Android app, which is mix of stopwatch and music player !

To start stopwatch simply press "start" after app launch, but nothing playing yet.
To play music:

* press "Update music tracks"
* next go to "Themes" section in navigation drawer
* add new theme
* add tracks to it
* go back to themes list
* and set active that new theme
Then when you start stopwatch, music plays :)
